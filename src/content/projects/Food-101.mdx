title: 'Food-101'
summary: 'This food classifier employs the EffNEtB2 model to categorize 101 distinct types of food, trained on the Food101 dataset. The initial training comprised 10 epochs with a batch size of 32, followed by fine-tuning for an additional 5 epochs with a batch size of 16. The user interface is built using the Gradio API, and the deployed model is hosted on the HuggingFace Spaces platform.'
