## Procedurally Generated World

This project employs Three.js to create a procedurally generated world with terrain generated using simplex noise. GL Matrix facilitates camera movement, and lil-gui is utilized for project GUI. The use of seed-random ensures a unique appearance each time. Stats.js displays the Frames Per Second (FPS). Project bundling is achieved through Webpack, Vite.js serves the project, and the final deployment is on Vercel.
