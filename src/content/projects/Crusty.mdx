### Features

- **C Language Parsing**: Parses C source code and translates it into intermediate representations.
- **Intel-Based Assembly**: Outputs assembly code compatible with Intel architectures.
- **Rust-Based**: Written in Rust for performance and safety.
- **Compilation Ready**: Generates assembly code suitable for direct compilation.
